### Hi there, I'm Angela ðŸ‘‹

I am a bright and highly-motivated Software Engineer who is passionate about making an impact through my work. In my next role, I am looking to tackle difficult problems with innovative solutions to drive meaningful change where it matters the most. 

As part of Twitterâ€™s Build team, I architected, designed, and implemented engineering solutions to facilitate the migration of Twitterâ€™s build tool from Pants to Bazel. These solutions improved developer productivity and development velocity for 1000+ engineers. 

At Twitter, I used Python, bash scripting, and CI tools to facilitate the migration of 130k+ targets from Pants to Bazel. I also have experience making backend web applications with Ruby, Rails, SQL, HTML, and CSS.
