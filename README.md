### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a bright and highly-motivated Software Engineer who loves working towards team goals. I harnessed my skills for problem-solving, teamwork, and analytical thinking as a Mechanical Engineer in leading Oil and Gas organizations. 

Now I am focusing on using these skills to build software solutions that align with my values. Be that harnessing human potential through accessible applications, advancing connected devices technology, or protecting our environment.

I am confident working with Ruby, Rails, SQL, HTML, and CSS. Iâ€™ve also worked with Python and C. In my ideal job, I work on a team using breakthrough technology to create radical solutions that solve big, meaningful problems. I pride myself on being a great collaborator and empathetic teammate. I am known to do thorough and thoughtful code reviews that spark conversations and improve the codebase. 

#### What I am working on
